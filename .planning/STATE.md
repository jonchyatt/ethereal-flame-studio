# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-19)

**Core value:** Phone to published video without touching a computer
**Current focus:** Phase 26 -- MCP Bridge + Tool Discipline (all plans complete, verifying)

---

## Current Position

Phase: 26 of 33 (MCP Bridge + Tool Discipline)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase (all complete)
Status: Verifying
Last activity: 2026-03-20 -- Completed 26-03 fire orb POC

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**v1.0:** 35+ plans completed across 5 phases
**v2.0:** 18 plans completed across 7 phases
**v3.0 (parallel):** 3/17 plans (Phase 19 complete, Phases 20-25 queued)
**v4.0:** 3/3 plans in Phase 26 complete

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- blender-mcp for Claude-Blender bridge (TCP:9876, 180s timeout)
- Async patterns mandatory: `bpy.app.timers.register()` for bakes, `INVOKE_DEFAULT` for renders
- Audio JSON bridge: browser export once, never re-analyze in Python
- Keyframe Flow objects, not Domain parameters (Blender T72812 workaround)
- Resolution ladder: 64 prototype, 128 test, 256 production, 512 if hardware allows
- Phase 7 (v1.0) superseded by v4.0 Phases 26-33
- Force-add .gitkeep in gitignored dirs (negation rules alone insufficient on initial add)
- 0.1s timer delay ensures MCP response sent before bake callback fires
- Single shared status file (blender/cache/.efs_status.json) for all async operations
- OpenImageDenoise default denoiser -- 128 samples comparable to 2048 without denoising
- exec(open()) needs __file__ fallback for MCP script execution
- Blender 5.0.1 Mantaflow FIRE bake crashes (MANTA::initHeat bug) -- use 4.5 LTS for fire sims

### Critical Pitfalls (from research)

- 180s MCP timeout kills bakes/renders silently -- async from day one
- Mantaflow cache explosion (30-180+ GB) -- dedicated cache dir, start at resolution 64
- Screenshot tokens compound ($5-15/day without discipline) -- use text feedback primarily
- Mantaflow Domain keyframing broken (T72812) -- keyframe Flow objects only
- Cycles + Mantaflow fire = corrupted frames (T77678) -- verify every test render frame-by-frame
- Blender 5.0.1 Mantaflow FIRE crashes in MANTA::initHeat -- SMOKE works fine, FIRE needs 4.5 LTS

### Blockers

None blocking. Blender 5.0.1 fire crash is documented but not blocking (pipeline validated via smoke).
