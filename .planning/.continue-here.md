<current_state>
Project v1 is COMPLETE and DEPLOYED to production at whatamiappreciatingnow.com

Recent session focused on:
1. Production deployment (Vercel + Cloudflare Tunnel + Docker services)
2. Audio reactivity improvements (asymmetric attack/release smoothing)
3. Mobile UI fixes (viewport meta, scroll constraints, audio bar widths)
</current_state>

<completed_work>

## Deployment
- Vercel deployment configured with custom domain
- Cloudflare Tunnel connecting to home server for GPU rendering
- Docker services running (Redis, n8n, cloudflared)
- DNS configured: whatamiappreciatingnow.com + n8n subdomain

## Audio Reactivity Improvements
- Implemented asymmetric smoothing: fast attack (0.4), slow release (0.04)
- Audio-driven particle visibility (minVisibility 0.15 when quiet)
- Increased default intensity from 1.0 to 1.7

## Mobile UI Fixes
- Added viewport meta tag preventing zoom issues
- ControlPanel max-height 70vh with overflow scroll
- Reduced audio bar widths (w-24 -> w-12) and gaps (gap-6 -> gap-3)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

## Uncommitted Changes
Many files modified but not committed:
- ParticleLayer.tsx (asymmetric smoothing)
- AudioControls.tsx (narrower bars)
- ControlPanel.tsx (scroll constraints)
- visualStore.ts (default intensity 1.7)
- layout.tsx (viewport meta)

Consider: Either commit these polish changes or create a v1.1 milestone.

## Future Considerations (v2)
- Visual quality improvements (particle asymmetry, organic shapes)
- 8K rendering via Blender integration
- Multi-platform posting via Blotato
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- **Asymmetric smoothing**: Fast attack (0.4) for immediate response to audio spikes, slow release (0.04) for graceful fade - user specifically liked the fade effect
- **Particle visibility**: minVisibility 0.15 keeps particles visible but faded when quiet, giving good contrast when audio hits
- **Default intensity 1.7**: User wanted "where 1.7 is right now" to be the new default
- **Mobile UI**: Viewport meta prevents double-tap zoom, max-height prevents control panel takeover
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - everything is working and deployed.

<context>
The user is using this for meditation videos on YouTube (VR/360 content).
The app renders audio-reactive particle orbs ("Ethereal Flame" and "Ethereal Mist" modes).

Key aesthetic: Warm fire colors (yellow -> orange -> red), organic undulating motion,
visible when audio plays, fades gracefully when quiet.

<next_action>
When resuming:
1. Review uncommitted changes - decide whether to commit as v1.1 polish
2. Check if user has feedback from testing production deployment
3. If starting new work, consider running `/gsd:progress` to see project state
