<current_state>
Phase 11 Playwright testing of jarvis.whatamiappreciatingnow.com completed successfully. All core features verified working. Dashboard was initially empty due to API auth issue - fixed by redeploying to Vercel which refreshed the NEXT_PUBLIC_JARVIS_SECRET env var.
</current_state>

<remaining_work>

- 11-03: Rate limiting - Not started
- 11-04: Error boundaries - Not started
- 11-05: Production deployment finalization - In progress (deployed, needs monitoring)
- 11-06: Monitoring and alerts - Not started
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- NEXT_PUBLIC_JARVIS_SECRET was already in Vercel env vars but needed redeploy to pick up
- Dashboard showing "No tasks for today" etc is legitimate - Notion data is empty for current date
- favicon.ico 404 is minor issue (cosmetic)
- ScriptProcessorNode deprecation warning is non-blocking
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None currently - production deployment working
</blockers>

<context>
Jarvis is deployed to jarvis.whatamiappreciatingnow.com and fully functional. The full voice pipeline works end-to-end. Dashboard loads Notion data (currently showing empty because no tasks/events for today).

The env var issue was that NEXT_PUBLIC_JARVIS_SECRET existed but the deployment needed to be refreshed to pick it up - solved by running `vercel --prod`.

Redis connection errors during build are from BullMQ and are non-fatal warnings (build succeeds).

<next_action>
Start with: Continue to 11-03 Rate Limiting plan, or verify Notion integration by adding a test task in Notion and confirming it appears in Jarvis dashboard.
