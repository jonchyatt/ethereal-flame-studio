# Jarvis Tutorial Framework

> A structured onboarding and tutorial system for Jarvis
> Based on Simon's Notion Life OS onboarding approach
> Can be used for both Jarvis AND Atlas framework onboarding

---

## Pedagogical Principles (From Notion Life OS)

Simon's onboarding video demonstrates excellent teaching principles:

### 1. **Mindset First**
> "Use what is useful and ignore the rest"

Before diving into features, set expectations:
- This is a big system
- You don't need to use everything
- Adapt it to your needs
- Start simple, add complexity as needed

### 2. **Navigation Before Features**
Show users HOW to get around before showing WHAT they can do:
- 3 ways to navigate (menu, views, home)
- Where to find things
- How to get back to safety

### 3. **Overwhelm Alerts**
Periodically remind users:
> "Overwhelm alert! Keep it simple. If you just do one thing..."

### 4. **Progressive Disclosure**
- Start with essentials
- Add depth as user gets comfortable
- "You don't have to go too far with this"

### 5. **Visual Demos**
- GIFs showing actions
- Step-by-step walkthroughs
- "Let me show you..."

### 6. **Two Methods Pattern**
For complex tasks, offer:
- Simple method (recommended for beginners)
- Advanced method (for power users)

## Jarvis Onboarding Structure

### Module 0: Welcome & Mindset

**Duration:** 2-3 minutes

**Content:**
```
Welcome to Jarvis - your AI executive function partner.

MINDSET:
1. Use what is useful, ignore the rest
2. Jarvis adapts to you, not the other way around
3. Start with voice, add features as you need them
4. You can't break anything - experiment freely

WHAT JARVIS CAN DO:
- Voice conversations (your main interface)
- Morning/evening briefings
- Task and project management via Notion
- Bill tracking and reminders
- Life area awareness
- Persistent memory (remembers you)

WHAT JARVIS WON'T DO:
- Automatically execute without your approval
- Access anything without your permission
- Share your data with anyone
```

**Overwhelm Alert:**
> "If you only learn one thing: just talk to Jarvis. Say 'Hey Jarvis, what's on my plate today?' and go from there."

---

### Module 1: Navigation (3 Ways to Interact)

**Duration:** 5 minutes

**Content:**
```
THREE WAYS TO USE JARVIS:

1. VOICE (Primary)
   - Push-to-talk button
   - Speak naturally
   - Jarvis responds with voice + text
   - Best for: Daily use, quick tasks, conversations

2. DASHBOARD (Visual)
   - See tasks, calendar, habits at a glance
   - Click to expand details
   - Mobile-friendly tap interface
   - Best for: Overview, planning, reviewing

3. TELEGRAM (Remote) [Coming in v3]
   - Message Jarvis from anywhere
   - Works when away from computer
   - Same capabilities, text-only
   - Best for: On-the-go, overnight tasks
```

**Demo:**
- Show push-to-talk interaction
- Show dashboard panels
- Show how to navigate between views

**Overwhelm Alert:**
> "Start with voice only. The dashboard and Telegram are there when you need them."

---

### Module 2: Setting Up Your Life Areas

**Duration:** 5-7 minutes

**Why Life Areas First:**
> "Life areas are the top-level organization from which you view everything. Get these right, and everything else falls into place."

**Content:**
```
DEFAULT LIFE AREAS:
- Health & Fitness
- Career & Business
- Finances
- Family & Social
- Personal Growth
- Environment (home, spaces)
- Content Creation (optional)

HOW TO CUSTOMIZE:
Voice: "Jarvis, I want to add a new life area called Pets"
Voice: "Jarvis, I don't care about Content Creation, can we remove it?"

THE WHEEL OF LIFE:
- Rate each area 1-10
- See what needs attention
- Jarvis will gently remind you about neglected areas
```

**Demo:**
- Show life areas in dashboard
- Voice command to add new area
- Explain 28-day rolling baseline

**Exercise:**
> "Take 2 minutes now. Think of any life areas you want to add or remove. Tell Jarvis."

---

### Module 3: Adding Your First Goals

**Duration:** 5 minutes

**Content:**
```
GOALS ARE TOP-LEVEL TARGETS

Good goals are written as if achieved:
- "I'm proud of my consistent workout routine"
- "My emergency fund has 3 months of expenses"
- "I've published 12 YouTube videos this year"

HOW TO ADD GOALS:
Voice: "Jarvis, add a goal under Health & Fitness: I run three times a week"
Voice: "Jarvis, create a new goal for my career"

GOALS → PROJECTS → TASKS
- Goals are the destination
- Projects are the vehicle
- Tasks are the fuel
```

**Demo:**
- Add a goal via voice
- Show how it appears in the goal view
- Link goal to life area

**Overwhelm Alert:**
> "You don't need many goals. 3-5 meaningful goals per year is plenty. Quality over quantity."

---

### Module 4: The Brain Dump (Tasks & Projects)

**Duration:** 10 minutes

**Content:**
```
THE BRAIN DUMP

Get everything out of your head into Jarvis.

METHOD 1: Quick Voice Dump (Recommended)
"Jarvis, I need to remember to..."
"Jarvis, add a task: call the dentist"
"Jarvis, I have a project: renovate the bathroom"

METHOD 2: Structured Entry
Go through each life area:
"Jarvis, what tasks do I have for Health & Fitness?"
"Add: schedule annual checkup"
"Add: research gym memberships"

TASKS vs PROJECTS:
- Task = single action (1 step)
- Project = multiple tasks (many steps)

"Call the dentist" → Task
"Get teeth fixed" → Project (research, call, schedule, attend, follow-up)
```

**Demo:**
- Brain dump 5-6 items via voice
- Show them appearing in the system
- Convert one to a project

**Two Methods:**
1. **Simple:** Just dump tasks, don't worry about organization
2. **Advanced:** Link to life areas and projects as you go

**Exercise:**
> "Spend 5 minutes now. Tell Jarvis everything on your mind. Every task, project, worry. Just get it out."

---

### Module 5: Processing Your Inbox

**Duration:** 7 minutes

**Content:**
```
THE INBOX → SYSTEM FLOW

Items start in your inbox (unprocessed).
Processing means:
1. Does it need a due date? Add it.
2. Does it belong to a project? Link it.
3. Does it have a life area? Link it.
4. Is it urgent? Important? Both? Neither?

PRIORITY MATRIX:
- Urgent + Important → Do it now
- Important only → Schedule it
- Urgent only → Delegate or batch
- Neither → Is this even worth doing?

VOICE PROCESSING:
"Jarvis, let's process my inbox"
"What's the first item?"
"Make that urgent and important"
"Link it to the bathroom renovation project"
"What's next?"
```

**Demo:**
- Process 3-4 inbox items via voice
- Show priority matrix view
- Show linked views

**Overwhelm Alert:**
> "Don't process everything perfectly. Good enough is good enough. You can always update later."

---

### Module 6: The Daily Rhythm

**Duration:** 8 minutes

**Content:**
```
JARVIS'S DAILY TOUCHPOINTS

MORNING BRIEFING (Optional, ~5 min)
"Good morning. Here's your day..."
- Today's tasks
- Calendar events
- Bills due soon
- Habits to track
- Life area insights

MIDDAY CHECK-IN (Optional, ~2 min)
"Quick check-in. How's your day going?"
- Update task progress
- Capture new items
- Adjust priorities

EVENING WRAP (Optional, ~5 min)
"Let's wrap up your day..."
- What got done
- What needs to move to tomorrow
- Capture tomorrow's intentions
- Week preview

HOW TO ENABLE:

"Jarvis, I want check-ins at 2pm"
"Jarvis, skip evening wrap for now"
```

**Demo:**
- Show morning briefing flow
- Show how to interrupt/skip sections
- Show how to enable/disable

### Module 7: Using Voice Commands Effectively

**Duration:** 5 minutes

**Content:**
```
VOICE COMMAND PATTERNS

QUERIES:
"What's on my plate today?"
"Do I have any bills due this week?"
"What are my top priorities?"
"How's my Health & Fitness life area doing?"

ACTIONS:
"Add a task: [description]"
"Mark [task name] as complete"
"Create a project called [name]"
"Mark the electric bill as paid"

CONVERSATIONS:
"I'm feeling overwhelmed, can you help me prioritize?"
"What should I focus on this week?"
"Help me plan my weekend"

MEMORY:
"Remember that I prefer morning meetings"
"I told you about my dentist appointment, when was that?"
"What do you know about my work schedule?"

PRO TIP: Speak naturally. Jarvis understands context.
Don't: "Add task priority urgent due date tomorrow call mom"
Do: "I need to call my mom tomorrow, it's pretty urgent"
```

**Demo:**
- Show natural conversation flow
- Show how Jarvis interprets fuzzy commands
- Show memory in action

---

### Module 8: Bills & Finances

**Duration:** 5 minutes

**Content:**
```
BILL TRACKING

Jarvis connects to your Notion Life OS bills database.

"Jarvis, add a bill: Netflix $15.99 due on the 15th monthly"

MARK PAID:
"Jarvis, mark Netflix as paid"

CHECK STATUS:
"What bills are due this week?"
"What bills are unpaid?"
"How much do I owe this month?"

"How's my exercise streak?"

LIFE AREA AWARENESS:
Jarvis tracks activity across life areas.
If you haven't touched Health & Fitness in 2 weeks:
"I've noticed you haven't engaged with Health & Fitness lately. Everything okay?"

Not judgy. Just aware.
```

---

### Module 10: Jarvis's Memory

**Duration:** 5 minutes

**Content:**
```
WHAT JARVIS REMEMBERS

EXPLICIT MEMORIES:
"Remember that I prefer morning meetings"
"Remember my dentist is Dr. Smith"

INFERRED PATTERNS:
Jarvis notices patterns over time:
- You're most productive in the morning
- You tend to forget bill due dates
- You work on creative projects on weekends

CONVERSATION CONTINUITY:
Jarvis remembers what you talked about:
- Yesterday's conversation
- Last week's priorities
- Ongoing projects

MEMORY CONTROL:
"What do you know about me?"
"Forget that I said [x]"
"Clear all memories" (nuclear option)
```

**Demo:**
- Add a memory
- Ask Jarvis what it knows
- Show memory appearing in context

---

### Module 11: Overwhelm Recovery

**Duration:** 3 minutes

**Content:**
```
WHEN EVERYTHING FEELS LIKE TOO MUCH

Jarvis is designed for people who get overwhelmed.
That's the whole point.

IF YOU'RE OVERWHELMED BY JARVIS ITSELF:
- Turn off briefings temporarily
- Just use voice for simple tasks
- Ignore the dashboard
- Say: "Jarvis, I'm overwhelmed, help me simplify"

IF YOU'RE OVERWHELMED BY LIFE:
- "Jarvis, I can't handle all this. What's the ONE thing I should do?"
- "Help me pick just 3 things for today"
- "Everything feels urgent, can you help me sort?"

JARVIS WON'T ADD TO YOUR STRESS:
- No guilt about missed tasks
- No judgment about ignored items
- No pressure to use every feature

It's here to help, not to nag.
```

---

## Notion Template Mastery Addendum (Self-Guided)

Use this as a learning plan to get the full value from the Notion Life OS template.
This is designed for you (single-user), so keep it practical and lightweight.

### Setup Checklist (One-Time)
- Share the core databases with your Notion integration (Tasks, Projects, Areas, Habits, Bills).
- Confirm data source IDs in `.env` match your template.
- Verify property names in `src/lib/jarvis/notion/schemas.ts` match your actual database fields.
- Seed each core database with 1-3 items so Jarvis has real data to query.

### Template Map -> How to Practice
- Daily Action (Tasks, Projects, Areas, Habits)
  - Practice: add 3 tasks, link 1 task to a project, mark 1 task complete, log 1 habit.
  - Prompts: "Add a task...", "Link this to project...", "Mark X complete", "I did X today".
- Financial (Budgets, Subscriptions, Bills)
  - Practice: log 1 bill, ask for unpaid bills, mark 1 paid.
  - Prompts: "What bills are due?", "Mark X as paid".
- Knowledge (Notes, Journal, CRM, Topics)
  - Practice: add 1 note, 1 journal entry, 1 CRM contact.
  - Prompts: "Add a note about...", "Create a journal entry...".
- Tracking (Workouts, Meals, Timesheets)
  - Practice: log 1 workout, add 1 meal plan entry, check streaks.
  - Prompts: "I worked out today", "Add dinner for Friday", "How is my streak?".
- Planning (Goals, Weekly Review, Year Planner)
  - Practice: add 1 goal, run a weekly review, schedule 1 priority for next week.
  - Prompts: "Add a goal...", "Start weekly review".
- Business (Content, Client OS, Portfolio)
  - Practice: add 1 content item, 1 client task, review portfolio list.
  - Prompts: "Add a content idea...", "Add a client task...".

### 7-Day Ramp Plan
- Day 1: Tasks + Projects (brain dump + 1 project).
- Day 2: Habits + Areas (set 3 habits, rate life areas).
- Day 3: Bills + Subscriptions (log bills, mark one paid).
- Day 4: Notes + Journal (capture 3 notes, 1 journal entry).
- Day 5: Meals + Workouts (plan 3 meals, log 1 workout).
- Day 6: Goals + Weekly Review (add 1 goal, run review).
- Day 7: Business (content ideas + client task).

### Daily Practice Loop (5 minutes)
1. Ask: "What's on my plate today?"
2. Add 1 task or habit update.
3. Mark 1 thing complete.
4. Ask: "Anything urgent or overdue?"

### Mastery Signals (You are fluent when...)
- You can add, complete, and re-prioritize tasks by voice without checking the UI.
- You trust the morning briefing enough to act on it.
- You run a weekly review without friction.
- Your core databases stay updated without manual cleanup.
